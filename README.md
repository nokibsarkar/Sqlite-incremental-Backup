# Sqlite-incremental-Backup
This is an utility script that incrementally backup SQLite3 Database. This approach was proposed by a [StackOverflow User](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60559099/9748238) which I turned into code. Currently the script may be run in two language NodeJs and Python (*Coming soon*). I am willing to convert this as a module. Feel free to convert into any language and let me know.
